  <p>
   Links to online resources, including notes, code samples, and external resources, will be posted on the <a href="/schedule.html">Schedule</a> page. Make sure to check the schedule early and often.
 </p>	

 <h2>Course Announcements</h2> 

 <p>
   Announcements will be posted in <a href="https://piazza.com/usfca/fall2016/cs112/home">Piazza</a>. Questions about assignments and projects should be posted on Piazza. Students are responsible for staying current on all course announcements.
 </p>

 <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>     
 <p>
   At the end of this course, successful students will be able to do all of the following:
 </p>
 <ul>
   <li>Implement medium-sized Java programs of 500-800 lines of code.</li>
   <li>Describe, trace programs using, and implement programs using the following intermediate-level programming concepts: 
    <ul>
      <li>arrays</li>
      <li>file i/o</li>
      <li>exception handling</li>
      <li>inheritance and object-oriented design principles</li>
      <li>built-in data structures and the Collections library</li>
      <li>recursion</li>
      <li>linked lists</li>
    </ul>
  </li>   
</ul>


<h2>Course Requirements</h2> 

<h4>Laboratory Assignments</h4>
<p>Weekly programming assignments will be due most weeks on Friday. You will usually be given class time to work on these assignments, allowing you to get help from the instructor. If you do not finish these assignments in class you will need to complete them on your own time. You may always seek help during office hours.</p>

<h4>Projects</h4>
<p>The project portion of your grade will be based on five substantial programming projects assigned throughout the semester. In some cases, your project grade will be based on the code you submit as well as an oral explanation and demonstration of the project on the day the project is due. A project assignment submitted on time is eligible for full credit. A project assignment submitted late by 24 hours or less is eligible for a maximum of 50%. A project assignment submitted more than 24 hours late is not eligible for credit. Extensions will be granted only in the case of a medical emergency verified by a doctor's note.</p>

<h4>Exams</h4>
<p>The exam portion of your grade will be based on two exams administered throughout the semester and one exam administered during the final exam period. You are responsible for being in class on the day of the exam. Make-up exams will be given only in the case of a medical emergency verified by a doctor's note.</p>

<h4>Participation and Quizzes</h4>
<p>You are expected to attend class, participate in class discussion, and participate in online discussion on Piazza. Pop quizzes may be administered any time. If you are not in class on the day of the quiz you will receive a 0 for the quiz.</p>

<h4>Code Review</h4>
<p>Any student may be asked to come in for code review for any assignment (lab or project). A student who does not meet with the instructor for a code review in a timely manner will be given a <strong>0</strong> on the assignment in question. A student who is unable to explain his/her code and answer the instructor's questions about his/her code as expected may receive a deduction of <i>up to</i> <strong>100%</strong>, resulting in a 0 on the assignment.</p>

<h2>Grade Breakdown</h2>

<p>The final grade for this course will be calculated as follows:</p>

<p>15% Assignments</p>
<p>30% Exams</p>
<p>50% Projects</p>
<p>5% Participation and Quizzes</p>

<p>Please note that this is a tentative breakdown and subject to change.</p>

<h2>Letter Grades</h2> 
<p>Letter grades will be assigned according to the following scale:</p>


<table class="table table-condensed" style="text-align:left;">
 <tr>
  <td>A+ ≥97%</td>
  <td>B+ ≥87%</td>
  <td>C+ ≥77%</td>
  <td>D+ ≥67%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
</tr>
<td>A ≥94%</td>
<td>B ≥84%</td>
<td>C ≥74%</td>
<td>D ≥64%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>A- ≥90%</td>
  <td>B- ≥80%</td>
  <td>C- ≥70%</td>
  <td>D- ≥60%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>F < 60%</td>
</tr>

</table>

For example, you will receive a C letter grade if your grade is greater than or equal to 74% and less than 77%. Please note this scale is subject to change. See the <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/catalog/regulations/student/">Undergraduate Student Regulations</a> for more information about letter grades and how they are translated into GPA.  

<h2>Attendance Policy</h2>
<p>Students are expected to be on-time to all classes. Attendance is mandatory for all exams, quizzes, labs, and exercises. Exam dates will be posted on the course <a href="/schedule.html">schedule</a>.</p>

<h2>Late Policy</h2>
<p>All deadlines and exam dates are firm. No late laboratories or quizzes will be accepted. Projects may be submitted up to 24 hours late but will incur a 50% deduction.</p>
<p>Exceptions to this policy are made only in the case of <i>verifiable</i> medical or family emergency. Extensions and makeup exams must be arranged <i>PRIOR</i> to the original deadline unless in case of extreme emergency (such as an emergency room visit).</p>

<h2>Academic Honesty</h2>

<p>All students are expected to know and adhere to the University of San Francisco's Academic Honor Code. Go to <a href="https://myusf.usfca.edu/academic-integrity/honor-code">https://myusf.usfca.edu/academic-integrity/honor-code</a> for details.</p>
<p>You must never represent another person’s work as your own.</p>
<p>Copying answers or code from other students or sources during a quiz, exam, or for a project or homework assignment is a violation of the university’s honor code.This includes copying code or other material from the web, and having anyone other than yourself complete your assignments. It also includes working too closely with another student. Collaboration or discussion that results in the same or very similar code indicates that you have not placed enough independent work into your solution and is a violation of the honor code.</p>
<p>Flagrant or repeat violations of the honor code will result in an F in the course, a report to the University Academic Integrity Committee, and a report to the Dean.</p>
<p>At the discretion of the instructor, a less severe penalty may be imposed for minor or first offenses. This is at the sole discretion of the instructor and any violation may result in an F in the course.</p>
<p>Examples of honor code violations include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Giving your code to another student.</li>
 <li>Submitting code written by anyone other than yourself as your own.</li>
 <li>Copying text from the web.</li>
 <li>Discussing implementation details of a solution with another student.</li>
 <li>Discussing code-specific details of a solution with another student.</li>    	    
</ul>
